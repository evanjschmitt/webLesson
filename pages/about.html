                <h1>Loops and Conditionals</h1>
                <p>Loops and conditional statements are fundamental concepts in programming that allow you to control
                    the flow
                    of your code and perform repetitive tasks based on certain conditions.</p>
                <h2>Loops:</h2>
                <p class="overview">
                    Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. There are
                    various
                    types of loops in programming, but the most common ones are <span id="boldText">for </span>loops,
                    <span id="boldText">while </span>loops, and
                    <span id="boldText">do-while</span> loops.
                </p>
                <div class="forLoops">
                    <h3>For Loops-</h3>
                    <p>This loop uses a varible (normally i for interger) as a counter, and completes the block of code
                        until it reaches a limit. </p>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <code>
                       <span class="parameter">for(i = 0; i < 5; i++) { <br>
                        <span class="indented"> console.log("Iteration " + (i + 1)); 
                        </span>
                        <br> }
                       <br><br>

                        //This code will put a log in the console stating the iteration, before increasing variable i. When i reaches 5, the loop will close.
                        </span>
                      </code>

                </div>
                <div class="whileLoops">
                    <h3>While Loops-</h3>
                    <p>The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. It
                        evaluates the condition before executing the code block, which means that if the condition is
                        initially false, the code block will not be executed at all. </p>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <code>
                       <span class="parameter">int i = 0; <br><br>
                        while (i < 5) { <br>
                           <span class="indented"> console.log(i); </span><br>
                           <span class="indented"> i++; </span>

                        <br><br>

                        //This code will log the number i is, as long as i is below five. After the number enters the log, the loop adds one to i and repeats.
                        </span>

                <div class="doWhileLoops">
                    <h3>Do While Loops-</h3>
                    <p>The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block once before
                        checking the condition. This ensures that the code block is executed at least once, even if the
                        condition is false initially.</p>

                    <p>Conditionals are statements that only work <span id="boldText">if</span> a specific condidtion is

                    <p>The if, else statement is a if statement with one major difference: it won't break everything if
                        the condidion isn't met. Instead, the loop will simply avoid the code within the "if" section,
                        instead running the "else" code.</p>
